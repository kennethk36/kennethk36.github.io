  <h1>Quadcopter Drone Build</h1>
  <p><strong>Focus:</strong> system integration, power/wiring constraints, ESC–FC compatibility, debugging</p>
</header>

<section>
  <h2>Problem</h2>
  <p>
    Build a quadcopter from components to learn the full integration pipeline—mechanical assembly,
    power distribution, ESC–flight controller signaling, and common failure modes during bring-up.
  </p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Constraints</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Budget:</strong> student budget using off-the-shelf FPV components</li>
    <li><strong>Tools:</strong> basic soldering + hand tools, limited test equipment</li>
    <li><strong>Design goal:</strong> learn wiring, grounding, and control signal routing (not just “buy-and-fly”)</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>System Overview</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Frame:</strong> lightweight quad frame with top-mounted battery for CG and component clearance</li>
    <li><strong>Propulsion:</strong> 4 motors + ESCs</li>
    <li><strong>Control:</strong> flight controller with gyro/accelerometer</li>
    <li><strong>Power:</strong> LiPo → main leads → power distribution → ESCs; regulated rails for FC</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    <em>Engineering takeaway:</em> a drone is not “electronics + software.” It is a tightly coupled system where
    wiring layout, grounding, vibration, and CG placement directly affect stability and reliability.
  </p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Design Decisions</h2>

  <h3>1) ESC selection and wiring approach</h3>
  <p>
    I initially chose individual ESCs to force myself to understand the full signal/power routing
    and motor control wiring. That increased wiring complexity and exposed compatibility issues that
    a 4-in-1 ESC would have hidden.
  </p>

  <h3>2) Component placement and CG</h3>
  <p>
    Battery placement was treated as a center-of-gravity problem: I aimed to keep mass near the midline
    to reduce control effort and improve stability. Mounting choices also considered prop clearance and
    cable strain relief to avoid intermittent failures.
  </p>

  <h3>3) Cable management as reliability engineering</h3>
  <p>
    Cable routing was planned to reduce vibration-induced fatigue and prevent wires from contacting props
    or sharp edges. Strain relief and short, clean runs were prioritized over “it fits.”
  </p>

  <h2>Bring-Up & Debugging</h2>

  <h3>Issue: FC–ESC compatibility / connector mismatch</h3>
  <p>
    During integration, I hit a mismatch between the flight controller’s expected ESC interface and the
    physical wiring I had available. This forced a redesign of how I routed signal and ground references
    and confirmed that “one ground point” on the controller does not mean “one ground wire total.”
  </p>

  <h3>What I learned</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Bring-up should be staged: power subsystem → FC power/boot → ESC power → motor spin test</li>
    <li>Grounding is not optional “black wires”; it is the reference for control signals</li>
    <li>Connector standards vary—plan interfaces before soldering permanent joints</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>How I would test next time (more disciplined)</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Continuity check after every solder stage (before applying battery)</li>
    <li>Smoke-stopper / current-limited first power-on</li>
    <li>Verify ESC signal mapping and motor order before props</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Results</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Assembled the full mechanical + electrical system and reached successful subsystem bring-up</li>
    <li>Identified interface mismatch early enough to avoid damaging components</li>
    <li>Documented wiring lessons that will reduce build time and risk in future iterations</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Next Steps</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Switch to a 4-in-1 ESC (or FC/ESC stack) to reduce wiring complexity and failure points</li>
    <li>Add vibration isolation + tidy harnessing to improve reliability</li>
    <li>Run structured flight tests: hover tuning → step inputs → endurance checks</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Photos / Evidence</h2>
  <p>
    Add 3–6 images here (build, wiring close-up, bench test). Create a folder at
    <code>assets/images/</code> and reference images like:
